# -Automated-LinkedIn-Form-Submission-and-URL-Tracking-using-Selenium
This project automates LinkedIn form submissions using Python and Selenium. It reads names from Excel, fills out a web form, submits each entry, and captures the resulting URL. The process reduces manual effort, improves accuracy, and is ideal for handling bulk data in marketing, recruitment, or lead generation tasks.
